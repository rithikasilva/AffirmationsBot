# AffirmationsBot :star::robot::star:

A robot for all your affirmation needs! 

This bot automatically gathers affirmations and posts them every hour for those in your server. Users can request affirmations too with the "!affirmation" command!

Users will need to create a config.py file to specify the bot token and specified message channel for hourly updates.

(THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS PROJECT, JUST FOR SOME FUN ðŸ˜„).

The bot runs on the "https://www.affirmations.dev/" API.
